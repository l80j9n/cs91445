Background 
For the past 2 years, Kāpiti Home Heating Solutions Limited (KHHS) has been struggling. Kyra Sun, the Managing Director and part owner, observes that sales of home heating products have decreased, and she suspects that this is because of strong competition from other Wellington heating providers, such as “Temperature Solutions” and “Smart Air Solutions”.
Kyra decides that the only way KHHS can survive is to modify the strategic position of the firm. Currently, KHHS competes by selling heating products and solutions to customers at the lowest price. However, this has resulted in a “price war” with its competitors. Therefore, Kyra has decided to alter the firm’s strategy to differentiate the way they package and market their heating products by offering a value-added service to their customers, using a new “Kyra home heating package” brand to add to the six low-cost heating solutions it currently offers, making a total of nine heating packages. Kyra believes this approach will enable KHHS to charge higher prices and she has set a net profit margin (return on sales) target of 15% for the “Kyra home heating package”.
Another strategy she is considering is whether to open a retail store in Paraparaumu to complement her online (website) and phone ordering service. As Kyra states “This way I will not have all my eggs in the same home heating solutions basket – so to speak.” 
The “Kyra home heating package” will be tailored to the specific house based on its size. The sales representative consults with the homeowner, determines the customer’s heating requirements and prepares a quote. The heating products required are generally a heat pump(s) and one, or a combination of another electric or gas product. These heating products and other equipment are obtained from several suppliers and installed by KHHS’s heating engineers.
In addition, as part of the initial consultation, the KHHS sales representative also provides the customer with advice about other heat-saving products, such as draught stops, double-glazed windows and thermal-lined curtains to improve household sustainability. This advice also includes contact details and information about special deals offered by independent suppliers from whom the customer can directly purchase these other products. Currently, KHHS does not receive any commission or fees from these recommendations.
Home Heating Packages 
Following 3 months of research into suitable “home heating packages”, Kyra, and her senior heating consultant, 代 写ACCY 302 Assignment – Trimester 2 2024Java

The total research and design costs ($64,800) are to be split across the three new “home heating packages” in proportion to the average floor area each package is designed to cover.
Details relating to the three “Krya home heating packages” that KHHS plans to launch onto the market are as follows:“Krya home heating package” Type Floor area 
(in metres2) Selling Price per                                           “home heating package”. 
Helios Heating Package 140 m2 $ 8,400 
Ra Heating Package 180 m2 $ 10,800 
Sol Heating Package 220 m2 $13,200 
The home heating packages have an expected market life of 4 years and during this time, Kyra estimates KHHS will sell the following number of packages:
Heating Package Sales year 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 
Helios  80 100 120 80 
Ra 60 80 100 60 
Sol 40 60 80 40 
An analysis of the costs for each home heating package” indicates that the following per package consultation and installation costs are expected:
Heating Package Helios Ra Sol 
$ $ $ 
Consultation costs 650 650 650 
Installation costs: 
Heating products and fittings 5,600 7,000 8,850 
Labour 650 800 1,000 
Overheads 165 200 250 
Total installation costs 6,415 8,000 10,100 
Total consultation and installation costs  7,065 8,650 10,750 
Kyra is happy with these figures “It looks like based on the per package selling price and the consultation and installation costs per package, I will make a healthy profit and easily achieve my required 15% net margin.” 
KHHS plans to spend a total of $27,000 per year, marketing all their nine (9) home heating solutions including the new heating packages. The annual marketing costs are to be allocated in equal amounts to each package. Based on experience, KHHS expects that customer service claims and repairs will cost them 3% of sales revenue.
Kyra recently attended a presentation on a cost management approach called “Strategic Cost Management” (SCM). The presentation covered value chains, value chain analysis, designing to meet customer price and quality expectations, and managing activities to reduce costs. Kyra thought that she could utilise this SCM approach including activity-based concepts at KHHS and improve its strategic position whilst reducing her costs at the same time and increasing her net margin.
Following this presentation, she has come to you, her accountant, for advice.
